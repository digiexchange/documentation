# DSX Documentation support 
#DSX/documentation
 
## Goal 
Work with the community and DSX network to create a more centralized curriculum or guidelines for best practices. 

	• Establish a common, open format (plaintext/Markdown/git)
	• DSX staff maintain repository and, with volunteer support, format docs
	• List existing docs, but also float up most up-to-date and useful
	• Partner with authors to keep docs up-to-date
	• Include or develop documentation about changing organizations: managing up, convincing leadership of need for change, changing culture and habits
	• Focus on long-term capacity

## How 
	- Conduct research to understand existing gaps, needs, and community politics  
	- Develop DSX documentation hub that syncs with existing platforms and authors 
		-  Identify core partners  (overlapping with DSX and separate) 
		- Conceptualize online platform 
		- Pull together volunteers and paid consultants to build it 

## What
### Research: Mapping resources and needs

	• What curricula exist already? Who are they designed for?
	• What is working for communities outside the U.S.?
	• What is needed in the U.S.?
	* What are the gaps for what is needed in the US with what is already out there (and also good)?
	• Who is creating and maintaining documentation?
	• What is the status of existing efforts? Do they need financial or human support? What can the DSX offer? Should we partner up or provide support for existing efforts?
	• Nathan is an author of much of the LevelUp documentation – he's interested in modernizing it and looping it into DSX

### Development: Conceiving of a new or adapted platform

	* What is best practice when creating a new list of lists (who has done this well in any sector)? Look for examples to model.
	• Format: Is it necessary to unify existing documentation using a universal, open, easy-to-use format and platform (e.g. plaintext/Markdown/git)?
	* How do we handle bringing in pieces of an existing resource, such as one module on this topic but not everything?
	• Linked to the core DSX site and platform?
	• Who would our core partners be on this? Would they overlap with DSX partners? Engineroom would be excellent on this.
	• How can we integrate this into the mission of DSX to connect capacity builders with orgs in need?
	* Not all resources are the same. How do we display the resources in a way that puts up front the goal of the resource and its niche? Like LevelUp is for trainers. SIAB is for end users but best delivered by a trainer. First-aid kit is for self-help online, etc.
	* Deciding what to do about resources relevant to this field that are not related to digital security directly in terms of content. Like a "code of conduct" at trainings, for example.
	* How do the soft skills and context sensitivity show up in documentation? Perhaps another case of clearly presenting "niche".

### Implementation: Publishing positions

	• Working with DSX to develop “positions,” or suggestions – documentation in context
	• Use versioning to keep everything up-to-date (partnering with authors)
	• Introducing “new” resources and filling in gaps identified in the research phase like border crossing recommendations, yubikeys, use of Chromebooks, etc
	• How to "mash up" existing resources but tweaking or localizing them.
	• What's the workflow when you've used 75% of a resource. Do you now maintain two copies of what is essentially the same document from now on?
